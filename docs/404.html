        <p>Sorry about this ladies and gentlemen - we couldn't find what you were looking for.</p>
        <p>There might a GREMLIN!</p>
        <p>Please stay calm - here are some options you have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check the address bar - you too might notice a gremlin hiding inside there.</li>
          <li>You might like to click the Back button and pretend this never happened - it was all just a bad dream...</li>
          <li>Alternatively, you might like to proceed towards the exit, where you will find comfort and safety: <a href="https://channeladam.com">ChannelAdam Homepage</a>.</li>
