    <h1>Uh oh... the Artificlal Intelligence says "I'm confused"</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Sorry about this - the Artificlal Intelligence in the machine couldn't find what you were looking for.</p>
        <p>This is a <em>good thing</em> - as it means that the AI hasn't yet become generally self-aware and taken over the world!</p>
        <p>Here are some options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check the address bar - you might find a moth inside that is causing a short-circuit.</li>
          <li>Click the Back button - taking the blue pill and pretending this never happened...</li>
          <li>Proceed to the <a href="https://hackthe.ai"><em>Hack the AI</em> Homepage</a>.</li>
        </ul>
